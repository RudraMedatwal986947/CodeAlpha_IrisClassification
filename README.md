>Iris Flower Classification – CodeAlpha Internship Task
>Project Overview

>This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

>Dataset
>The dataset contains:

>SepalLengthCm
>SepalWidthCm
>PetalLengthCm
>PetalWidthCm
>Species

>The dataset is clean and contains no missing values.

>Technologies Used

>Python
>Pandas
>NumPy
>Scikit-learn
>Matplotlib
>Seaborn
>Jupyter Notebook

>Steps Performed

>Data loading and exploration
>Data preprocessing (dropping ID, label encoding)
>Train-test split
>Feature scaling
>Model training (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
>Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
>Cross-validation
>Model comparison

>Results

>All models achieved high accuracy (above 95%).
>Cross-validation confirmed consistent performance across folds.
>Petal length and petal width were the most influential features.

>Conclusion

>The project demonstrates core classification concepts including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and validation. The Iris dataset provides a strong foundation for >understanding supervised learning techniques.
